This is a simple 2D platformer game I build in python.
I used only 2 modules:
-pgzrun  
-from pygame ONLY Rect.


Game:
Goal of the game is to collect all coins and get to the exit zone.
Move with left and right arrow and jump with space.
Touching enemies loses life and gives you short resistance.
Jumping on the enemies kills them.
